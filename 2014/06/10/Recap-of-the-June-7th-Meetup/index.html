<p>We got together at Amante, a coffee shop on Walnut St. It looked like rain all day but we sat outside anyway. While hanging out there we delved into philosophy, CJDNS, encryption, and radio. Naturally since it’s Boulder we had to mix in some talk about cycling.</p>
<h1 id="Are_you_who_you_say_you_are?_The_web_of_trust-">Are you who you say you are? The web of trust.</h1>
<p>Some of us are a bit green when it comes to working with our communication encryption. Luckily one of us was not and he took us through validating and signing each of our keys. Since we were each using the same software, <a href="https://gpgtools.org" target="_blank" rel="external">GPG Tools</a>, it was a breeze to do that.</p>
<p>Before meeting in-person we had some confidence of the other’s identity through some back and forth email and chatting but no way to know for sure. By meeting up in the big blue room we were able to validate via our key signatures and know for certain that the person we had correspondence with was the same. Neat!</p>
<h2 id="CJDNS_and_the_Node_Map">CJDNS and the Node Map</h2>
<p>Recently we’ve been setting up some nodes and getting them all connected. At this meeting I briefly showed a demo of a node scanner and node map which I am working on. Another thing we discussed was some strategy for getting nodes configured and also about wireless nodes.</p>
<p>I learned recently in a chat that there is a script doing some scanning which compiles a list of nodes connected since the first of the month. At the time of writing this, it’s at 887. I’m not sure geographically what that includes but only a few of those are ours here in Boulder. It will be an ongoing project to catalog our nodes here and build the database. With some more effort we’ll have a node graph and geo map setup.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns" target="_blank" rel="external">CJDNS</a> yet it’s an encrypted IPv6 network using a DHT for routing. It’s what <a href="https://seattlemesh.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Seattle Meshnet</a> and <a href="http://hyperboria.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Hyperboria</a> use to put together their network. We’re learning a lot from those projects.</p>
<h2 id="Meshers!">Meshers!</h2>
<p>These attendees I met at the meeting were mature, curious, and brilliant! Thank you for showing up. If you get a chance to goto the next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Meshnet/" target="_blank" rel="external">Meetup, Saturday, July 5th</a> you will certainly enjoy your time.</p>
<p>Please join us in the chat, mailing list, and meetup and tell us what you’re working on. It’s a community discussion and all are welcome.</p>
